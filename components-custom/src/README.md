# State and Events Design Process

### What state and event handlers are there?

1. List out what users will do and the *changes* they will see while using the app.

2. Categorize each step as 'state' or 'event handler'.

3. Group common steps. Remove duplicates. Re-write descriptions.


### What name and type?

4. Look at mockup. Remove or simplify parts that aren't changing.

5. Replace remaining elements with text descriptions.

6. Repeat #4 and #5 with a different variation.

7. Image you have to write a function that returns the text of steps #5 and #6. In addition to your component props, *what other arguments would you need?*


### Where is it defined?

8. Decide where each event handler and state will be defined.
